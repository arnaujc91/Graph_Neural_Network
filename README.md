# Graph convolutional networks

## 1. Introduction to Graph Neural Networks

Five groups: 

1. Graph convolutional networks
2. Graph attention networks
3. Graph auto-encoders
4. Graph generative networks 
5. Graph spatial-temporal networks. 

We will focus our attention to the first group: Graph convolutional networks

## 2. Graph convolutional networks
